		<h1>Summary of Chapter 1</h1>
		<p>1. HTML pages are text documents.</p>
		<p>2. HTML uses tags, which are characters that sit inside angled brackets. They act like containers and tell you something about the information that lies between them.</p>
		<p>3. Tags are often referred to as elements.</p>
		<p>4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.</p>
		<p>5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.</p>
		<p>6. Attributes require a name and a value.</p>
		<p>7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.</p>
